title: Buy software once, own it forever
---

Stop renting your software and start owning it.

With our software, you buy it once and own it forever. No more monthly fees, no more subscriptions, no more renting. Just buy it once and own it forever.

We believe that software should be something you own, not something you rent. That's why we offer our software as a one-time purchase, with no recurring fees or subscriptions.

When you buy our software, you get a perpetual license to use it forever. You can install it on as many devices as you like, and you'll never have to pay for it again.

So stop renting your software and start owning it. Buy our software once, and it's yours forever.
