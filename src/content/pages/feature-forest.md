## Frequently asked questions

### What is Feature Forest?

Feature Forest is an application for organising cards on in a discovery tree. If you've used Trello, or JIRA Kanban, or any of the other Kanban-style organisation applications, you'll already be familiar with the idea. It just adds depth. Create a project, create some cards representing what needs to be done, and organise them into appropriate trees.
